Description:
This is just collection of custom Twtich bots that I have made in different programming languages. This started as a learning exercise to get more familiar with python since I am not strong in that language am biased towards it. My goal is to also port these bots C/C++, Java, and Rust.


Known Issues:
When a user sends a message that ends in an exclaimation mark and then has more text, the regex only grabs the text after the exclaimation point.


To Do:
*Consolidate concurrent messages from a single user into one message.
*Ignore messages that purely URLS.
*Replace URLs and Links in a user message with the word *link*.
